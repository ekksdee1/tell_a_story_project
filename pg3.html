            After Midas found out that the wish was true, he rushed to put his clothes on and so that he could see
            himself in his dazzling gold outfit. Midas went through the house touching items until he got an idea. He
            decided to go out and turn the roses gold until he ws summoned for breakfast. Midas sat down at the table
            waiting for his daughter Marygold to come accompany him. After awhile she didn't show up so Midas requested
            that someone would go and get his daughter for him. When Midas saw his daughter crying he asked
            "Why are you crying on a beautiful morning?".
