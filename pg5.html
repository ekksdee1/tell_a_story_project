                Midas then kept attempting to stuff his mouth with some kind of food,
                but to no avail, as the Golden Touch prevented him from doing so. Marygold
                had the utmost desire to comfort Midas, so she shrew her arms around his
                knees, but she became a golden statue. Midas was devasted by this, as he
                believed his daughter's love was worth more than anything, including the
                Golden Touch.

                Marygold's rosy face, so full of emotion, had been turned into a statue with
                a glittering yellow color. You could see love, grief, and pity on her face,
                stuck in time. Midas began to wail, and began to believe that it was not real,
                his daughter had not been turned into gold.

                The stranger then came to visit him again, asking how he succeeded with the
                Golden Touch. Midas was miserable, he couldn't eat, his daughter was turned
                into a golden statue, et cetera. Midas learned his lesson to not be so greedy,
                to the point where he would take a measly cup of water or a piece of bread
                over the Golden Touch.
