            Midas calmed her down and then told her to sit down and enjoy her delicious breakfast. He then told
            Marygold that she will find it easy enough to exchange a golden rose like that. Midas then went to pour
            himself a cup of coffee and of course the coffee pot turned gold. After making coffee Midas took a spoon
            full of coffee and as soon as it touched his lips it changed to gold. He tried picking up a trout, a cake,
            and even a egg.

            What is Midas's problem during breakfast?
