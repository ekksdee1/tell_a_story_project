                King Midas was a very wealthy manâ€”maybe too much so. He had a daughter
                named Marygold, who he held dear to his heart. Midas was more fond
                of gold than anything else in the world, besides his daughter. He
                even owned a dungeon filled with his gold, often going down there
                to bask in his own wealth.

                One day, a mysterious figure approached him in his dungeon, asking
                for a wish. What was Midas's wish?
