            After Midas wished for the golden touch he was told to wait until sunrise tomrorrow there he would have
            his wish that he wished for. The next morning King Midas was wide awake and was touching objects that
            were within reach. He didn't know if the stranger was playing with him or not, but when he went to touch
            the bedside, and other multiple objects othing happened. Midas was disappointed. He would then soon get
            the golden touch by hitting the first beam of sunlight.

            What was the first object that turned gold when Midas touched it?
